## User Story:

-    As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.
-    As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
-    As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
-    As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.
-    As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
-    As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)
-    As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.
